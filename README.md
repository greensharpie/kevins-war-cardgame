### **_*Description*_**

#### The objective of te game is to win all of the cards. This is a two player game. The entire deck is divided evenly among the players. At the same time, each player reveals the top card of their deck -- this is a "battle" -- and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played.

<br/>

#### If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". Both players place the next three cards face down and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.

<br/>

#### The game ends when one player holds all of the cards.
